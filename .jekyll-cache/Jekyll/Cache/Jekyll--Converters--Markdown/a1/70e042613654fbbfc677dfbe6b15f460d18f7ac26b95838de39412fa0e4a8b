<p>This is a concept design for an apartment finding web service… that’s a mouthful. I designed this with Adobe Xd.

<p>I’ve gotten significantly better at putting together a website mock-up. When I first started off designing websites a few years ago I wasn’t too familiar with the web design world.  I had a hard time putting together something presentable, most of my designs looked like really bad websites from the early 2000s.</p>

<p>My designs have a lot more thought into them now. One way I’ve improved is by becoming more familiar with element spacing, taking advantage of it can help you  convey a message while keeping a reader fascinated with the structure of the content. I read an interesting article from <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/whitespace/">Mark Boulton</a> that explains “whitespace” or “negative space” in depth, it  helped things click for me.  I found his explanation on  “passive whitespace” and the effect it can have on the reader’s attention very useful. By spacing out your written content you can prevent content from looking cramped essentially making it easier and more enjoyable to read.  I’ve applied “passive whitespace” in the call-to-action and throughout the design in this mock-up.</p>
