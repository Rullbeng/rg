<h3 id="description">Description</h3>

<p>This is a concept design for an apartment finding web serviceâ€¦ thatâ€™s a mouthful. I designed this with Adobe Xd. If your interested in web design and you need a program to start off with you can download it here for FREE <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html">Download Adobe Xd</a>.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve gotten significantly better at putting together a website mock-ups. When I first started off designing websites a few years ago I wasnâ€™t too familiar with the web design world.  I had a hard time putting together something presentable, most of my designs looked like really bad websites from the early 2000s.</p>

<p>My designs have a lot more thought into them now. One way Iâ€™ve improved is by becoming more familiar with element spacing, taking advantage of it can help you  convey a message while keeping a reader fascinated with the structure of the content. I read an interesting article from <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/whitespace/">Mark Boulton</a> that explains â€œwhitespaceâ€ or â€œnegative spaceâ€ in depth, it  helped things click for me.  I found his explanation on  â€œpassive whitespaceâ€ and the effect it can have on the readerâ€™s attention very useful. By spacing out your written content you can prevent content from looking cramped, making it easier and more enjoyable to read.  Iâ€™ve applied â€œpassive whitespaceâ€ in the call-to-action and throughout the design in this mock-up.</p>
